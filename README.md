# Introduction
Hello! My name is Daniel Saul, and I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) student at the University of Georgia (UGA), planning to graduate in May 2023. I am originally from Franklin, Tennessee, a 25-minute drive south of Nashville, but I spent the last 4 years in Athens at UGA completing my Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Information Systems (MIS) with an Area of Emphasis in Data Analytics. I love the creative abilities data and technology has to offer, and I enjoy partaking in personal projects to help myself expand my knowledge and grow! I am working as a Student Assistant for the MIS department at UGA and plan to join Invesco's digital wealth firm, intelliflo, as a Business Operations Engineer in late July!

## Web Application Development  
### Solar Panel Simulation
**Concepts:** Interactive Web App Development, API's, Data Transformation, Data Analytics, Data Visualization

**Software & Languages:** R, Python, System Advisor Model (SAM)

**Packages:** shiny, reticulate, tidyverse, DT, shinyBS, shinyjs, shinyalert, shinythemes, shinydashboard, pandas, numpy, requests, pysam

**Description:** With this solar panel simulation application, users can enter zipcode, solar panel/system, and financial inputs to run a simulation that provides analysis of energy and financial outputs based on a certain location's weather data. The weather data used is a typical meteorological year (TMY) file which represents the average weather conditions over a select year range. It is extracted from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and run through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) SAM model. Outputs are visualized through plots and tables at an annual, monthly, and hourly basis. This project is currently in progress through my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia.

### UGA Baseball Heatmaps
**Concepts:** Interactive Web App Development, Data Transformation, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Sports Analytics

**Software & Languages:** R

**Packages:** shiny, tidyverse, plotly

**Description:** This web application was built for the University of Georgia baseball team's pitchers and pitching coaches to help analyze pitching and opposing players batting habits and win more games. It resulted from a semester-long project for a sports analytics directed study elective completed during my first semester in the MSBA. My team and I were tasked with building less clunky and smooth heat maps based on pitching location within a strike zone combined with the outcome of the pitch. The application has been built in iterations by previous groups, so we were responsible for creating two tabs, pitching and hitting heat maps, along with various other baseball-related statistics in the visuals. Users can input the season, game or range of games, batter side, pitch types, pitch outcomes, and pitcher in which faceted heat maps and a statistics table are generated. Inputs are similar for the batting analysis, except that the heat maps display the pitch location pitched to the opposing batter, faceted by the outcome of the pitch instead of the pitch type. Sample photos and the select code we used are included in the repository to prevent access or sharing of sensitive or personal information.
