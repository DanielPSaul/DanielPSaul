[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ShinyApps.io-Open_Web_App-3686d3?logo=r)](https://daniel-saul.shinyapps.io/Solar-Panel-Simulation/)

**Concepts:** Interactive Web App Development, API's, Data Transformation, Data Analytics, Data Visualization

**Software & Languages:** R, System Advisor Model (SAM), PVWatts

**Packages:** shiny, rsconnect, shinythemes, shinydashboard, DT, tidyverse, shinyalert, shinyBS, shinyjs, leaflet, zipcodeR, plotly, lubridate, httr, reshape2, writexl, xlsx, readxl

**Description:** With this solar panel simulation application, users can enter zipcode, solar panel/system, and financial inputs to run a simulation that provides analysis of energy and financial outputs based on a certain location's weather data. The weather data used is a typical meteorological year (TMY) file which represents the average weather conditions over a select year range. It is extracted from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and run through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) SAM model. Outputs are visualized through plots and tables at an annual, monthly, and hourly basis. This project is one of the apps developled during my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia.

**Software & Languages:** R

**Packages:** shiny, rsconnect, tidyverse, lpSolve, shinythemes, shinydashboard, DT, shinyalert, shinyjs, shinyBS, rmarkdown, xlsx, readxl, writexl

**Description:** With this simple solar panel optimization calculator, users enter an anlysis period, panel, electricity, and demand inputs then outputs the total cost of the solar project, optimal number of panels, and purchased kWh per analysis year for greenhouse applications. The results can be adjusted based on new panel energy generatiion and downloaded to an Excel file. This project is one of the apps developled during my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia.

**Packages:** shiny, rsconnect, shinythemes, shinydashboard, DT, tidyverse, shinyalert, shinyBS, shinyjs, leaflet, zipcodeR, plotly, lubridate, httr, reshape2, writexl, xlsx, readxl

**Description:** With this simple perovskite solar panel project cost calculator, users enter location and various levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) inputs such as total installation cost, discount rate, and annual panel energy generated. Then, a basic table and visualizations, which are downloadable, are outputted with the overall calculated LCOE compared to local commercial, industrial, and residential eletricity prices offered by the local power company. Users can also select to enter an LCOE value they already have and simply compare to the electricity rates. This project is one of the apps developled during my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia. Specifically, requirements were gathered from the Physics Department at UGA for perovskite solar cells they are developing.

### UGA Baseball Heatmaps
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-6e5494?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/DanielPSaul/BaseballHeatmaps)

**Concepts:** Interactive Web App Development, Data Transformation, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Sports Analytics

**Software & Languages:** R

**Packages:** shiny, tidyverse, plotly

**Description:** This web application was built for the University of Georgia baseball team's pitchers and pitching coaches to help analyze pitching and opposing players batting habits and win more games. It resulted from a semester-long project for a sports analytics directed study elective completed during my first semester in the MSBA. My team and I were tasked with building less clunky and smooth heat maps based on pitching location within a strike zone combined with the outcome of the pitch. The application has been built in iterations by previous groups, so we were responsible for creating two tabs, pitching and hitting heat maps, along with various other baseball-related statistics in the visuals. Users can input the season, game or range of games, batter side, pitch types, pitch outcomes, and pitcher in which faceted heat maps and a statistics table are generated. Inputs are similar for the batting analysis, except that the heat maps display the pitch location pitched to the opposing batter, faceted by the outcome of the pitch instead of the pitch type. Sample photos and the select code we created are included in the repository as well as the full app code.

The capstone project required that each group selects a local business with a feasible problem we solve using technology and the project manangement lifecycle. We decided to build an interactive website for a donut shop located in Lawrenceville, Georgia because they were struggling with customer engagement and online orders due to the pandemic and its only consumer communication source being a Facebook page. The webpage is equiped with online ordering capabilities, general store information such as hours and history, menus, product photo galleries, social media links, company news, contact form functionality, and more.

We decided to create a system for an online clothing store called "Custom Clothing Athens." We included scenario flowcharts, demonstrations, and UML diagrams. It covers the data types: Arrays, ArrayLists, HashSets, and HashMaps. The project also covers the object-oriented programming principles Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. Since this project focused more on the server side and not the user interface, I have included the code and my group's presentation report which will help the viewer visualize the project.

**Concepts:** Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Analysis

**Software & Languages:** Tableau, R

**Packages:** tidyverse, rvest, caret, dbplyer, corrplot

**Description:** This report was conducted as part of a group project for a Business Intelligence course I took at UGA. My group and I were tasked with picking any current topic and making a prediction of some sort with it. Every spring, the popular Men's NCAA March Madness basketball tournament is played and millions of fans create brackets and compete to see who can predict a winner. Our group decided it was the perfect time to attempt to predict a March Madness winner with machine learning methods. We sourced our data from Kaggle, created descriptive visualizations with Tableau, and made a traditional OLS regression model with R running repeatedly to predict the most tournament wins. We trained the model on data from the 2015 - 2019 seasons and tested the model on the 2021 season. Our model yielded 34% more points than the average bracket and has a meaningful impact on bracket performance as a result.

**Software & Languages:** SQL, MySQL

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This project was conducted as a group for a Data Management and Analytics course I took at UGA. It was actually the first coding class I ever took, so please bare with me. My group was tasked with finding a real technology problem for a company, building a database and queries to help fix part of the issues, and make recommendations on what to do next. We decided to create new hypothetical subscription plans for FitBit: one being a sleep database and tracker, and the second being recommendations generated for a user with the "original" database. I do not have access to the database anymore, but I did include the SQL queries in a file included in the repository. The report displays the business problem, queries and outputs, data dictionaries, and database model.

We were given the option to choose a topic to conduct our analysis on in which I chose the effect of increasing temperatures on housing prices in the United States. The temperature data was sourced from from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and housing price data from the FRED database. My findings determined that the causal effect is significant and the forecasted values display an increase in the relationship of both climate change and housing costs.
