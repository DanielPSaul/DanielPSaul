# Introduction ü§ù
Hello! My name is Daniel Saul, and I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) student at the University of Georgia (UGA), planning to graduate in May 2023. I am originally from Franklin, Tennessee, a 25-minute drive south of Nashville, but I spent the last 4 years in Athens at UGA completing my Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Information Systems (MIS) with an Area of Emphasis in Data Analytics. I love the creative abilities data and technology has to offer, and I enjoy partaking in personal projects to help myself expand my knowledge and grow! I am working as a Student Assistant for the MIS department at UGA and plan to join Invesco's digital wealth firm, intelliflo, as a Business Operations Engineer in late July!

## Web Application Development  
### Solar Panel Simulation
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-6e5494?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/DanielPSaul/SolarPanelApp)

**Concepts:** Interactive Web App Development, API's, Data Transformation, Data Analytics, Data Visualization

**Software & Languages:** R, Python, System Advisor Model (SAM)

**Packages:** shiny, reticulate, tidyverse, DT, shinyBS, shinyjs, shinyalert, shinythemes, shinydashboard, pandas, numpy, requests, pysam

**Description:** With this solar panel simulation application, users can enter zipcode, solar panel/system, and financial inputs to run a simulation that provides analysis of energy and financial outputs based on a certain location's weather data. The weather data used is a typical meteorological year (TMY) file which represents the average weather conditions over a select year range. It is extracted from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and run through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) SAM model. Outputs are visualized through plots and tables at an annual, monthly, and hourly basis. This project is currently in progress through my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia.

### UGA Baseball Heatmaps
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-6e5494?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/DanielPSaul/BaseballHeatmaps)

**Concepts:** Interactive Web App Development, Data Transformation, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Sports Analytics

**Software & Languages:** R

**Packages:** shiny, tidyverse, plotly

**Description:** This web application was built for the University of Georgia baseball team's pitchers and pitching coaches to help analyze pitching and opposing players batting habits and win more games. It resulted from a semester-long project for a sports analytics directed study elective completed during my first semester in the MSBA. My team and I were tasked with building less clunky and smooth heat maps based on pitching location within a strike zone combined with the outcome of the pitch. The application has been built in iterations by previous groups, so we were responsible for creating two tabs, pitching and hitting heat maps, along with various other baseball-related statistics in the visuals. Users can input the season, game or range of games, batter side, pitch types, pitch outcomes, and pitcher in which faceted heat maps and a statistics table are generated. Inputs are similar for the batting analysis, except that the heat maps display the pitch location pitched to the opposing batter, faceted by the outcome of the pitch instead of the pitch type. Sample photos and the select code we used are included in the repository to prevent access or sharing of sensitive or personal information.

### Donut Shop Website

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-6e5494?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/DanielPSaul/DonutShopWebsite)

**Concepts:** Cloud-Based Web App Development, Project Management

**Software & Languages:** Wix.com

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This website was built with the cloud-based website service, Wix.com, for a project management course group project at UGA. The capstone project required that each group selects a local business with a feasible problem we solve using technology and the project manangement lifecycle. We decided to build an interactive website for a donut shop located in Lawrenceville, Georgia because they were struggling with customer engagement and online orders due to the pandemic and its only consumer communication source being a Facebook page. The webpage is equiped with online ordering capabilities, general store information such as hours and history, menus, product photo galleries, social media links, company news, contact form functionality, and more.

### Food Blog Website
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-6e5494?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/DanielPSaul/FoodBlogWebsite)

**Concepts:** Network Applications, Static Web Development

**Software & Languages:** Apache Tomcat, HTML, CSS, Eclipse

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This basic website was a project I worked on and created in a network application and web development course at UGA. We were tasked with building static website based on minimal visual requirements. It is modeled from a food blog Instagram page I currently operate. It includes recipes, pictures, tips, and contact information. I have included a sample photo of the home page, but I recommend opening the index.html file to explore the site.

### Clothing Shopping App
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-6e5494?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/DanielPSaul/ClothingShopApp)

**Concepts:** Application Development, Object-Oriented Programming Principles, System Process Management

**Software & Languages:** Java, Eclipse

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This report was a group project I worked on in a business programming course at UGA. We were tasked with creating an inventory database and system for a hypothetical online shopping system of our choosing. We decided to create a system for an online clothing store called "Custom Clothing Athens." We included scenario flowcharts, demonstrations, and UML diagrams. It covers the data types: Arrays, ArrayLists, HashSets, and HashMaps. The project also covers the object-oriented programming principles Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. Since this project focused more on the server side and not the user interface, I have included the code and my group's presentation report which will help the viewer visualize the project.
