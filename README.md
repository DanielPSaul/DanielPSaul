# Introduction

Hello! My name is Daniel Saul, and I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) student at the University of Georgia (UGA), planning to graduate in May 2023. I am originally from Franklin, Tennessee, a 25-minute drive south of Nashville, but I spent the last 4 years in Athens at UGA completing my Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Information Systems (MIS) with an Area of Emphasis in Data Analytics. I am also working as a Student Assistant for the MIS department at UGA.

Currently, I am looking for a full-time position upon graduation as a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Tech Consultant, or Data & Analytics Consultant.
