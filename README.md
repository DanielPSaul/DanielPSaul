# Introduction

Hello! My name is Daniel Saul, and I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) student at the University of Georgia (UGA), planning to graduate in May 2023. I am originally from Franklin, Tennessee, a 25-minute drive south of Nashville, but I spent the last 4 years in Athens at UGA completing my Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Information Systems (MIS) with an Area of Emphasis in Data Analytics. I love the creative abilities data and technology has to offer, and I enjoy partaking in personal projects to help myself expand my knowledge and grow! I am working as a Student Assistant for the MIS department at UGA and plan to join Invesco's digital wealth firm, intelliflo, as a Business Operations Engineer in late July!

## Web Application Development  
### Solar Panel Simulation
**Concepts:** Interactive Web App Development, API's, Data Transformation, Data Analytics, Data Visualization

**Software & Languages:** R, Python, System Advisor Model (SAM)

**Packages:** shiny, reticulate, tidyverse, DT, shinyBS, shinyjs, shinyalert, shinythemes, shiny dashboard, pandas, numpy, requests, pysam

**Description:** With this solar panel simulation application, users can enter zipcode, solar panel/system, and financial inputs to run a simulation that provides analysis of energy and financial outputs based on a certain location's weather data. The weather data used is a typical meteorological year (TMY) file which represents the average weather conditions over a select year range. It is extracted from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and run through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) SAM model. Outputs are visualized through plots and tables at an annual, monthly, and hourly basis. This project is currently in progress through my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia.
